Summary: This project  is a modern adaption of the beloved classic frogger. It is also inspired by the populer 2014 game Crossy Road. I wanted to combine frogger and crossy road and create a game where the player is trying to cross the road and avoid cars. I added several new ideas such as free movement, unlockable skins and a boss fight.
