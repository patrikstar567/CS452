Summary: This project  is a modern adaption of the beloved classic frogger. It is also inspired by the populer 2014 game Crossy Road. 
I wanted to combine frogger and crossy road and create a game where the player is trying to cross the road and avoid cars. 
I added several new ideas such as free movement, unlockable skins and a boss fight.

Demo Video:

What did I learn: I learned alot from this project the main idea is how to create a system where data persists across different sessions.
I had to design a database in SQLite that could store players and their scores and unlockables. This helped me to be able to apply
concepts learned in class such as aggregation for the high scores and sum for the coins. 

Ai Integration: My project does not have AI integration

AI Use: I utilized AI at various stages to help me solve complex problems such as how to get the sprite sheets to work and general debugging
and problem solving. 

Why is this project interesting: I found this project intersting because I have always loved classic video games and I have always wanted
to do a reimagining of one with a twist and new ideas. This was finally my oppertunity to do so as a class project and I had a really fun time
designing it and creating it. I especially found creating the ingame shop to be intersting and how it interacts with the backend. 

Key Learnings: 

Failover Strategy: Although this game runs locally and doesn’t implement distributed failover, I learned what a failover strategy would involve.
What I learned conceptually: Failover means having a backup database or server ready if the primary fails. SQLite doesn’t support automatic failover, but migrating to a server DB would.
Understanding failover helps me reason about reliability and redundancy even in simple systems. I also learned how to protect the game state from corruption with Reliable systems prevent duplicate actions, corrupted records, or inconsistent state.
